# Note

 `svelte-webpack-configured` is currently tested as a binary-like system test. Because of this, we need to copy the `cypress/` and `src/` directories from the `project-fixtures/svelte` directory. Once https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader/issues/243 is resolved and testing becomes a regular system test again, we can remove these directories.
